For example, the change to how the plugin classpath looks like a good thing to do, but it's unrelated to applying Kotlin examples in the documentation. It's also confusing to me in its current form as sometimes the classpath is configured in the test, and sometimes the classpath is configured in the build script. I'd prefer that the classpath is configured consistently across the whole module. Do you have time to break things up further? I'd really like to keep the changes in this PR focussed solely on adding Kotlin examples.\n\nAlso, I wonder if a Suite-based approach could be taken for testing the Groovy and Kotlin examples that are included in the documentation.

Matplotlib can't make that assumption, and indeed many people will plot a \"time series\" with the independent variable on the y axis, not to mention plots that are not monotonic in either axes.\n4) even if it were a time series, your method of downsampling is very susceptible to aliasing and will definitely have strange artifacts due to preserving the local extrema.
